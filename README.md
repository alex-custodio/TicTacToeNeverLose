# Tic Tac Toe Never Lose
This is a project made in Golang. A game of tic-tac-toe that never loses. Using the minimax algorithm, I created an interesting gaming experience where the AI never loses.

## What is minimax?
Minimax is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario1. It is widely used in two-player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc2. The two players are called the maximizer and the minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible2.

In this project, I implemented the minimax algorithm in Golang to create an AI that never loses in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI calculates the best move to make by exploring all possible outcomes of the game and choosing the move that results in the best outcome for itself. This creates an interesting and challenging gaming experience for the player.

This project showcases my skills in Golang and my understanding of game theory and artificial intelligence. It is a great example of how algorithms can be used to create intelligent and unbeatable AI in games. I hope you enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe Never Lose! ðŸ˜Š
